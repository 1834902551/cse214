### DOUBLE WAY NON-CIRCULAR LINKED LIST


#### INTRODUCTION:

*A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. A doubly linked list contains an extra pointer, typically called previous, together with the next pointer and data. A doubly list can be circular or non-circular. In non-circular doubly linked list, the head previous and the last next both will always points to the NULL. This list can be traversed in both direction.
Here I implemented some following functions for non-circular doubly linked list:

1. Menu ()
2. Display ()
